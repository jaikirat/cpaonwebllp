# Feature Specification: Global Layout and Navigation Shell

**Feature Branch**: `003-build-a-global`
**Created**: 2025-09-13
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build a global layout and navigation shell for the application. This includes a responsive header, footer, container grid, mobile navigation drawer, and breadcrumb placeholders. The purpose is to establish a consistent page scaffolding across all routes, ensuring users experience a unified structure while navigating the app. This also sets the foundation for accessibility, active link highlighting, and scalable inner-page navigation."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Identified need for global navigation shell and layout structure
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: All users visiting the application
   ‚Üí Actions: Navigate between pages, access navigation on mobile/desktop
   ‚Üí Data: Navigation links, breadcrumb paths, page content
   ‚Üí Constraints: Responsive design, accessibility requirements
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific navigation items and hierarchy not defined]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: breadcrumb generation logic not specified]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí User flows for desktop and mobile navigation defined
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement focused on user experience and layout behavior
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí Navigation structure and breadcrumb data entities
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí WARN "Spec has uncertainties regarding navigation content"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Users need a consistent navigation experience across all pages of the application. They should be able to easily understand where they are in the site, navigate to different sections, and have the interface adapt appropriately to their device (mobile, tablet, desktop). The layout should provide a professional, unified appearance that builds trust and makes the application feel cohesive.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user visits any page on desktop, **When** they look at the page, **Then** they see a consistent header with navigation links and a footer with relevant information
2. **Given** a user visits any page on mobile, **When** they need to navigate, **Then** they can access a mobile-friendly navigation drawer or menu
3. **Given** a user navigates between different sections, **When** they look for their current location, **Then** they see breadcrumb indicators showing their position in the site hierarchy
4. **Given** a user is on any page, **When** the page content loads, **Then** it appears within a consistent container grid that maintains proper spacing and alignment
5. **Given** a user with accessibility needs, **When** they navigate using assistive technology, **Then** all navigation elements are properly labeled and keyboard accessible

### Edge Cases
- What happens when navigation items are too numerous for the available screen space?
- How does the system handle very long page titles in breadcrumbs?
- What happens when users disable JavaScript and the mobile navigation drawer needs to function?
- How does the layout adapt for users with very large or very small text size preferences?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display a consistent header across all application pages containing primary navigation elements
- **FR-002**: System MUST display a consistent footer across all application pages containing secondary links and information
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide a responsive container grid that maintains proper content alignment and spacing on all screen sizes
- **FR-004**: System MUST offer mobile-optimized navigation that works on touch devices and smaller screens
- **FR-005**: System MUST display breadcrumb placeholders that indicate the user's current location within the site hierarchy
- **FR-006**: System MUST highlight the currently active navigation item to show users their current page context
- **FR-007**: System MUST ensure all navigation elements are keyboard accessible and screen reader compatible
- **FR-008**: System MUST maintain consistent visual styling and branding across all layout components
- **FR-009**: Navigation MUST Define the exact navigation items (Home, Services, Pricing, Industries, About, Resources, FAQs, Contact, Client Portal, Legal) and how they are organized (primary menu in header, secondary links in footer). Ensure correct behavior on desktop and mobile, with visibility changes for logged-in vs. guest users
- **FR-010**: Breadcrumb system MUST automatically reflect the site hierarchy from the URL (e.g., Home ‚Ä∫ Services ‚Ä∫ Tax Filing). Always start with Home, last item not a link, hide on the homepage, and support SEO with JSON-LD markup. Use human-friendly labels, collapse if paths are too deep, and include accessibility attributes

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Navigation Structure**: Represents the hierarchical organization of site sections, including primary and secondary navigation items, their labels, destinations, and access permissions
- **Breadcrumb Path**: Represents the trail of pages leading to the current location, including parent pages, current page identifier, and navigation depth level
- **Layout Container**: Represents the consistent wrapper that contains page content, including grid constraints, responsive breakpoints, and spacing rules
