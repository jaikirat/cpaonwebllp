# Research: Global Layout and Navigation Shell

**Feature**: 003-build-a-global
**Date**: 2025-09-13
**Status**: Complete

## Research Summary

All technical choices are well-defined based on existing project architecture and user requirements. No ambiguities requiring research were found in the technical context.

## Technology Decisions

### Decision: Next.js App Router with TypeScript
**Rationale**:
- Already established in the project architecture
- App Router provides built-in layout capabilities via `layout.tsx` files
- TypeScript ensures type safety for component props and navigation structures
- SSG compatibility supports SEO requirements from FR-010

**Alternatives considered**:
- Pages Router: Rejected due to less flexible layout system
- Plain React: Rejected due to lack of SSG capabilities and routing

### Decision: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui
**Rationale**:
- Already configured in the project with design tokens
- shadcn/ui provides accessible components (WCAG AA compliance for FR-007)
- Utility-first approach enables responsive design (FR-003, FR-004)
- Design system consistency supports FR-008

**Alternatives considered**:
- CSS-in-JS solutions: Rejected due to SSG build complexity
- Plain CSS: Rejected due to lack of design system consistency

### Decision: Radix UI for Accessibility
**Rationale**:
- Foundation for shadcn/ui components
- Built-in ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation (FR-007)
- Unstyled components allow for custom theming
- Progressive enhancement support for no-JS users

**Alternatives considered**:
- Headless UI: Rejected due to shadcn/ui already using Radix
- Manual ARIA implementation: Rejected due to complexity and error-proneness

## Implementation Patterns

### Decision: Component-based Layout Structure
**Rationale**:
- Aligns with React/Next.js best practices
- Modular components enable testing of individual layout parts
- Reusable components support consistent styling (FR-008)
- Easy to maintain and extend for future navigation items

**Alternatives considered**:
- Monolithic layout component: Rejected due to testing and maintenance complexity
- Higher-order components: Rejected due to prop drilling complexity

### Decision: Client-side State for Mobile Navigation
**Rationale**:
- React state management for mobile menu toggle
- No external state library needed (simplicity principle)
- Progressive enhancement with CSS fallbacks
- Fast response times (<200ms for FR-004 performance goals)

**Alternatives considered**:
- Zustand/Redux: Rejected due to overkill for simple toggle state
- CSS-only solution: Considered but accessibility requirements favor JS enhancement

## Performance Strategy

### Decision: CSS-based Animations with JavaScript Enhancement
**Rationale**:
- Tailwind CSS animations provide 60fps performance (performance goals)
- JavaScript enhancement for complex interactions (mobile drawer)
- CSS fallbacks ensure functionality without JS (progressive enhancement)
- Small bundle size impact

**Alternatives considered**:
- Animation libraries (Framer Motion): Rejected due to bundle size for simple animations
- Pure CSS animations: Insufficient for complex mobile drawer behavior

## SEO and Accessibility Strategy

### Decision: JSON-LD Breadcrumb Markup
**Rationale**:
- Required by FR-010 for SEO support
- Structured data enhances search result appearance
- Automated generation from URL structure
- Compatible with SSG builds

**Alternatives considered**:
- Microdata: Rejected in favor of JSON-LD for maintainability
- No structured data: Rejected due to SEO requirements

### Decision: ARIA Navigation Landmarks
**Rationale**:
- Required by FR-007 for accessibility compliance
- Screen reader navigation enhancement
- Standard HTML5 semantic elements with ARIA enhancement
- Keyboard navigation support

**Alternatives considered**:
- Basic semantic HTML only: Insufficient for WCAG AA compliance
- Complex ARIA state management: Overkill for navigation structure

## Testing Strategy

### Decision: Jest + React Testing Library + Playwright
**Rationale**:
- Already established in project architecture
- RTL focuses on user behavior testing (accessibility-first)
- Playwright E2E tests for navigation flows across devices
- Real DOM testing (no mocks for layout components)

**Alternatives considered**:
- Enzyme: Rejected due to React 18 compatibility issues
- Cypress: Rejected in favor of already-configured Playwright
