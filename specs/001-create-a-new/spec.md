# Feature Specification: Next.js TypeScript Project with Cloudflare Pages CI/CD

**Feature Branch**: `001-create-a-new`  
**Created**: 2025-09-10  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "create a new nextjs project which uses type script Initialize Git repo, connect to Cloudflare Pages for automated builds. Ensures reliable CI/CD from day one."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Extract: Next.js project setup, TypeScript configuration, Git initialization, Cloudflare Pages integration
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: developers, CI/CD system
   ‚Üí Actions: create project, setup TypeScript, initialize Git, configure deployment
   ‚Üí Data: project files, build artifacts
   ‚Üí Constraints: automated builds, reliable CI/CD
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: target deployment environment specifics]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí User flow: developer creates project ‚Üí pushes code ‚Üí automated deployment
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement tested via build/deployment success
6. Identify Key Entities (project structure, configuration files)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí Mark implementation uncertainties for planning phase
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer, I want to create a new Next.js TypeScript project with automated deployment pipeline so that I can focus on building features while having confidence that my code changes are automatically built and deployed reliably.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** no existing project, **When** I initialize the Next.js TypeScript project, **Then** I have a working development environment with proper TypeScript configuration
2. **Given** a configured project, **When** I push code changes to the repository, **Then** Cloudflare Pages automatically builds and deploys the application
3. **Given** a deployment failure, **When** I check the CI/CD status, **Then** I receive clear feedback about what went wrong and can fix the issue
4. **Given** a successful deployment, **When** I visit the live URL, **Then** my application is accessible and functioning correctly

### Edge Cases
- What happens when build fails due to TypeScript errors?
- How does system handle deployment rollbacks if needed?
- What occurs during Cloudflare Pages service outages?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST create a Next.js project with TypeScript support and proper configuration
- **FR-002**: System MUST initialize a Git repository with appropriate .gitignore and initial commit
- **FR-003**: System MUST integrate with Cloudflare Pages for automated deployments
- **FR-004**: System MUST trigger builds automatically on code changes pushed to repository
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide build status feedback and deployment URLs
- **FR-006**: System MUST support development, staging, and production deployment workflows 
Use a 3-tier branch strategy:

feature/* ‚Üí Preview deploys (ephemeral URLs).

staging ‚Üí Stable staging environment (branch alias like staging.cpaonweb.com).

main ‚Üí Production deployment (cpaonweb.com).
- **FR-007**: System MUST maintain deployment history and allow rollbacks 
  Primary rollback = use Cloudflare Pages‚Äô ‚ÄúPromote previous deployment‚Äù (instant restore of last good build).
Secondary rollback = Git revert the bad commit on main and redeploy.
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle build failures gracefully with meaningful error messages

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Project Configuration**: Next.js and TypeScript configuration files, package.json dependencies
- **Repository**: Git repository with branches, commits, and deployment triggers
- **Build Pipeline**: Automated build process that compiles TypeScript and creates production artifacts
- **Deployment Environment**: Cloudflare Pages hosting environment with domain and SSL configuration
