## Deployment Workflow

### Branch Strategy

| Branch Type | Purpose | Deployment Target | URL Pattern |
|-------------|---------|-------------------|-------------|
| `main` | Production | Production environment | `https://cpaonweb.com` |
| `staging` | Pre-production testing | Staging environment | `https://staging.cpaonweb.com` |
| `feature/*` | Feature development | Preview deployments | `https://[hash].cpaonweb.pages.dev` |

### Deployment Pipeline

#### Feature Development Flow
1. **Create Feature Branch**: `git checkout -b feature/new-feature`
2. **Develop and Test**: Local development with hot reload
3. **Push Changes**: `git push origin feature/new-feature`  
4. **Preview Deployment**: Automatic deployment to preview URL
5. **Create Pull Request**: Request merge to staging branch
6. **Code Review**: Required before merge approval
7. **Status Checks**: All checks must pass before merge

#### Staging Flow
1. **Merge to Staging**: Feature branch merged to `staging`
2. **Staging Deployment**: Automatic deployment to staging environment
3. **Integration Testing**: Manual or automated testing in staging
4. **Production Promotion**: Create PR from staging to main

#### Production Flow
1. **Merge to Main**: Staging branch merged to `main`
2. **Production Deployment**: Automatic deployment to production
3. **Health Checks**: Verify deployment success
4. **Monitoring**: Ongoing monitoring and alerts

## Build Pipeline Details

### Build Process

The build pipeline executes these steps for every deployment:

1. **Environment Setup**
   ```bash
   Node.js version: 18.x LTS
   Package manager: npm
   Build timeout: 10 minutes
   ```

2. **Dependency Installation**
   ```bash
   npm ci  # Clean install from package-lock.json
   ```

3. **Code Quality Checks**
   ```bash
   npm run type-check  # TypeScript compilation
   npm run lint        # ESLint code analysis
   ```

4. **Application Build**
   ```bash
   npm run build       # Next.js production build
   ```

5. **Asset Deployment**
   - Static files uploaded to Cloudflare CDN
   - Cache headers configured for optimal performance

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Value | Purpose |
|----------|-------|---------|
| `NODE_ENV` | `production` | Runtime environment |
| `NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED` | `1` | Disable Next.js telemetry |
| Custom variables | As needed | Application configuration |

### Status Checks

Required status checks for protected branches:

- **build**: Application builds successfully
- **type-check**: No TypeScript errors
- **lint**: Code passes ESLint rules

## Security Implementation

### Branch Protection Rules

**Main Branch Protection:**
- Require pull request reviews (1 approver minimum)
- Require status checks to pass
- Require branches to be up to date before merging
- Restrict pushes that create files larger than 100 MB
- Include administrators in restrictions
- Allow force pushes: ❌
- Allow deletions: ❌

**Staging Branch Protection:**
- Same rules as main branch
- Ensures quality control for pre-production

### Access Control

**Repository Access Levels:**
- **Admin**: Repository owners and lead developers
- **Write**: Team members who can create branches and PRs
- **Read**: Contractors or external collaborators

**Cloudflare Pages Access:**
- Project administrators can modify build settings
- Deployment history visible to authorized users
- Environment variables secured and encrypted

### Security Best Practices

1. **Secrets Management**: Use environment variables, never commit secrets
2. **Dependency Security**: Regular npm audit and security updates
3. **SSL/TLS**: Automatic HTTPS with Cloudflare Universal SSL
4. **Content Security**: Security headers configured via Cloudflare
5. **Access Logs**: Monitor deployment and access patterns

## Performance Characteristics

### Build Performance

| Metric | Target | Typical |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Build Time | < 10 minutes | 3-5 minutes |
| Dependency Install | < 5 minutes | 1-2 minutes |
| Type Check | < 2 minutes | 30 seconds |
| Lint Check | < 1 minute | 15 seconds |

### Runtime Performance

| Metric | Target | Implementation |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| First Contentful Paint | < 1.5s | Static site generation |
| Time to Interactive | < 3s | Code splitting and lazy loading |

| Global Coverage | 99%+ | Cloudflare's 200+ edge locations |

### Caching Strategy

**Static Assets:**
- Cache-Control: `public, max-age=31536000` (1 year)
- Immutable content with versioned filenames

**HTML Pages:**
- Cache-Control: `public, max-age=0, must-revalidate`
- Fresh content with CDN edge caching

**API Routes** (if applicable):
- Configurable caching based on content type
- Support for ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration)

## Monitoring and Observability

### Key Metrics

**Deployment Metrics:**
- Deployment frequency (target: multiple times per day)
- Build success rate (target: > 95%)
- Mean time to deployment (target: < 10 minutes)
- Failed deployment recovery time (target: < 15 minutes)

**Application Metrics:**
- Page load times across global regions
- Error rates and types
- Core Web Vitals scores
- User experience metrics

### Alerting

**Build Failures:**
- GitHub commit status updates
- Email notifications (configurable)
- Slack/Discord webhooks (optional)

**Runtime Issues:**
- Cloudflare Analytics for performance monitoring
- Custom monitoring via Web Analytics API
- Third-party monitoring services (DataDog, New Relic, etc.)

### Logging

**Build Logs:**
- Complete build output available in Cloudflare Pages
