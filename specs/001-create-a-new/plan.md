# Implementation Plan: Next.js TypeScript Project with Cloudflare Pages CI/CD

**Branch**: `001-create-a-new` | **Date**: 2025-09-10 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-create-a-new/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
4. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
5. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, or `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI).
6. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
7. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
8. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Create a Next.js TypeScript project with automated CI/CD pipeline using Cloudflare Pages for reliable deployment from day one. Includes GitHub repository setup with branch protection, development workflow configuration, and comprehensive documentation for manual setup and testing procedures.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x with Next.js 14.x  
**Primary Dependencies**: Next.js, React, TypeScript, ESLint, Tailwind CSS  
**Storage**: N/A (static site generation/deployment)  
**Testing**: Jest/React Testing Library  
**Target Platform**: Web browsers via Cloudflare Pages CDN
**Project Type**: web (frontend application)  
**Performance Goals**: Fast page loads via SSG/ISR, optimized builds  
**Constraints**: Cloudflare Pages deployment limits, GitHub branch protection policies  
**Scale/Scope**: Single project repository with staging/production environments

**User Requirements Integration**:
- GitHub repository creation with branch protection for main and staging branches
- Cloudflare Pages integration for automated deployments
- Next.js project with TypeScript configuration
- Manual setup documentation for user reference
- Testing implementation guide with proper testing procedures
- Feature documentation for development workflow

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Simplicity**:
- Projects: 1 (Next.js web application with CI/CD setup)
- Using framework directly? ✓ (Next.js used directly, no wrapper frameworks)
- Single data model? ✓ (Static site, no complex data models needed)
- Avoiding patterns? ✓ (No unnecessary abstractions for project setup)

**Architecture**:
- EVERY feature as library? N/A (Project setup, not feature libraries)
- Libraries listed: Project configuration utilities (package.json, next.config.js, CI/CD configs)
- CLI per library: N/A (Setup scripts and npm commands)
- Library docs: Documentation in markdown format planned

**Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**:
- RED-GREEN-Refactor cycle enforced? ✓ (Tests written before implementation)
- Git commits show tests before implementation? ✓ (CI/CD pipeline tests first)
- Order: Contract→Integration→E2E→Unit strictly followed? ✓ (Build pipeline as contract test)
- Real dependencies used? ✓ (Actual Cloudflare Pages deployment)
- Integration tests for: deployment pipeline, build process, environment configs
- FORBIDDEN: Implementation before test, skipping RED phase ✓

**Observability**:
- Structured logging included? ✓ (Build logs, deployment logs via Cloudflare)
- Frontend logs → backend? N/A (Static site deployment)
- Error context sufficient? ✓ (CI/CD failure notifications and build logs)

**Versioning**:
- Version number assigned? ✓ (1.0.0 for initial setup)
- BUILD increments on every change? ✓ (Automated via CI/CD)
- Breaking changes handled? ✓ (Branch protection, staged deployments)

**Structure Decision**: Option 2 (Web application) - Next.js frontend with CI/CD configuration

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `/scripts/update-agent-context.sh [claude|gemini|copilot]` for your AI assistant
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Generate tasks based on the 3-tier deployment setup and user requirements
- Repository setup and configuration tasks
- Next.js project initialization with TypeScript
- GitHub branch protection implementation
- Cloudflare Pages integration and deployment
- Documentation creation (manual setup and feature docs)
- End-to-end workflow testing and validation

**Task Categories**:
1. **Project Setup** [P]: Initialize Next.js project with TypeScript, dependencies
2. **Repository Configuration**: GitHub setup, branch protection, access control  
3. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Cloudflare Pages integration, build configuration
4. **Documentation**: Manual setup guide, feature documentation, quickstart
5. **Testing & Validation**: End-to-end workflow testing, deployment verification

**Ordering Strategy**:
- Infrastructure first: Repository and branch setup
- Project initialization: Next.js with TypeScript configuration
- Integration: Cloudflare Pages connection and deployment
- Documentation: User guides and technical documentation  
- Validation: Complete workflow testing

**Estimated Output**: 15-20 numbered, ordered tasks covering:
- GitHub repository creation and branch protection setup
- Next.js TypeScript project initialization
- Cloudflare Pages integration and custom domain configuration
- Manual setup and feature documentation creation
- End-to-end testing and deployment validation

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
