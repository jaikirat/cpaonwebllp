# Phase 0: Research Findings - Unified Design System

## Research Summary
This document consolidates research findings for implementing a unified design system with modern web technologies, focusing on design tokens, component architecture, and accessibility.

## Design Token Strategy

### Decision: CSS Custom Properties + Tailwind CSS Integration
**Rationale**:
- Enables runtime theme switching through CSS custom properties
- Leverages Tailwind's utility classes for compile-time optimizations
- Provides IntelliSense and type safety through TypeScript integration
- Supports responsive design tokens through Tailwind's responsive utilities

**Implementation approach**:
- CSS custom properties in `:root` for base token values
- Tailwind config extends theme with CSS custom property references
- TypeScript definitions for design token autocomplete

**Alternatives considered**:
- **CSS-in-JS (styled-components/emotion)**: Too heavy for static design tokens, adds runtime overhead
- **Sass variables**: No runtime theme switching capability, less integration with modern tooling
- **Pure CSS custom properties**: Limited IntelliSense and type safety compared to Tailwind integration

## Component Library Architecture

### Decision: shadcn/ui + Radix UI Primitives
**Rationale**:
- Radix UI provides accessible, unstyled component primitives with proper ARIA attributes
- shadcn/ui offers a copy-paste workflow that maintains component ownership
- Components are fully customizable without being locked into a design system
- Excellent TypeScript support and documentation
- Active community and regular updates

**Implementation approach**:
- Install Radix UI primitives for complex components (Dialog, Accordion, etc.)
- Use shadcn/ui CLI to generate base component implementations
- Customize components to consume design tokens from Tailwind theme
- Co-locate components in `src/components/ui/` directory

**Alternatives considered**:
- **Headless UI**: Less comprehensive primitive set, tailored more for Tailwind CSS without token flexibility
- **Chakra UI**: Too opinionated with built-in theming that conflicts with custom design tokens
- **Material-UI**: Heavy bundle size, specific design language that doesn't align with custom branding
- **Custom implementation**: Too much development overhead for accessibility and cross-browser compatibility

## Testing Strategy

### Decision: Multi-layered Testing with Jest + React Testing Library + Playwright
**Rationale**:
- Jest + React Testing Library for unit and integration testing of component logic
- Playwright for visual regression testing and cross-browser compatibility
- Real DOM testing ensures accessibility features work correctly
- Visual regression catches styling changes that break design consistency

**Implementation approach**:
- Unit tests for component props, states, and user interactions
- Integration tests for theme switching and component composition
- Visual regression tests for design token changes and component variants
- Accessibility testing with axe-core integration

**Alternatives considered**:
- **Storybook + Chromatic**: Adds complexity with additional build pipeline, external service dependency
- **Cypress**: Less efficient for component testing compared to React Testing Library
- **Manual testing only**: Insufficient for maintaining design system consistency at scale

## Theme System Architecture

### Decision: CSS Custom Properties with Semantic Token Naming
**Rationale**:
- Semantic naming (primary, secondary, accent) allows theme switching without component changes
- CSS custom properties enable runtime theme updates
- Layered token system: primitive → semantic → component tokens

**Implementation approach**:
```css
:root {
  /* Primitive tokens */
  --blue-500: #3b82f6;
  --gray-900: #111827;

  /* Semantic tokens */
  --color-primary: var(--blue-500);
  --color-text: var(--gray-900);

  /* Component tokens */
  --button-primary-bg: var(--color-primary);
}

[data-theme="dark"] {
  --color-text: #f9fafb;
  --color-primary: #60a5fa;
}
```

**Alternatives considered**:
- **Direct primitive references**: Makes theme switching difficult
- **JavaScript theme objects**: No runtime switching without re-rendering entire app

## Performance Optimization

### Decision: Tree-shakeable Exports with Bundle Analysis
**Rationale**:
- Individual component exports allow importing only needed components
- Tailwind CSS purging removes unused utility classes
- Next.js tree-shaking removes unused JavaScript

**Implementation approach**:
- Export components individually from `@/components/ui`
- Use barrel exports only for related component groups
- Configure Tailwind purging to scan component files
- Monitor bundle size with webpack-bundle-analyzer

## Accessibility Standards

### Decision: WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance with axe-core Testing
**Rationale**:
- WCAG 2.1 AA provides comprehensive accessibility guidelines
- axe-core automated testing catches most accessibility issues
- Radix UI primitives provide accessible behavior out of the box
- Manual testing supplements automated testing for screen reader compatibility

**Implementation approach**:
- All interactive components support keyboard navigation
- Color contrast ratios meet WCAG AA standards (4.5:1 for normal text)
- Focus indicators are visible and consistent
- Reduced motion preferences are respected in animations
- Screen reader compatibility tested with NVDA/JAWS
