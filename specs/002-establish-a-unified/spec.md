# Feature Specification: Unified Design System

**Feature Branch**: `002-establish-a-unified`
**Created**: 2025-09-13
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Establish a unified design system for the app. Define brand tokens (colors, spacing, typography, radii, shadows) and responsive scales, plus accessible focus/hover/disabled states. Build a core set of reusable UI components (buttons, cards, inputs, dialogs, accordions, form elements) that all consume these tokens. Provide a living \"sandbox\" page to preview variants and states. The goal is visual and behavioral consistency, faster page assembly, and built-in accessibility (contrast, keyboard navigation, reduced-motion)."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature description provided: design system with tokens and components
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: developers, designers, users
   ‚Üí Actions: define tokens, build components, preview variants
   ‚Üí Data: design tokens, component states, accessibility properties
   ‚Üí Constraints: visual consistency, accessibility compliance, responsive design
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí All core concepts are clearly defined in the description
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí User flows: developer component usage, designer token updates, accessibility testing
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement covers tokens, components, sandbox, and accessibility
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí Design tokens, UI components, component variants, accessibility states
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí No technical implementation details, focused on user value
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer building UI features, I need a consistent set of design tokens and reusable components so that I can quickly assemble pages with uniform visual styling and built-in accessibility without having to recreate common patterns or worry about design inconsistencies.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I'm building a new page, **When** I use the design system components, **Then** the visual styling automatically matches the brand guidelines and accessibility standards
2. **Given** I need to implement a form, **When** I use the design system form components, **Then** all inputs have consistent focus states, proper contrast ratios, and keyboard navigation support
3. **Given** I want to see all available component variations, **When** I visit the sandbox page, **Then** I can preview all component states (default, hover, focus, disabled) and variants in one place
4. **Given** a designer updates the brand colors, **When** they modify the design tokens, **Then** all components automatically reflect the new styling without individual component changes
5. **Given** a user navigates with a keyboard, **When** they interact with any design system component, **Then** focus indicators are clearly visible and navigation follows logical tab order

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a component is used in a context with insufficient contrast ratios?
- How does the system handle users with reduced motion preferences?
- How do components behave when content overflows expected boundaries?
- What happens when components are nested or combined in unexpected ways?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a complete set of design tokens including colors, spacing, typography, border radii, and shadows
- **FR-002**: System MUST include responsive scale definitions for spacing, typography, and component sizing
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide reusable UI components including buttons, cards, inputs, dialogs, accordions, and form elements
- **FR-004**: Components MUST consume design tokens for all styling properties to ensure consistency
- **FR-005**: Components MUST include accessible focus, hover, and disabled states with proper contrast ratios
- **FR-006**: System MUST support keyboard navigation for all interactive components
- **FR-007**: System MUST respect user reduced-motion preferences in animations and transitions
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide a sandbox page that displays all component variants and states
- **FR-009**: Sandbox MUST allow real-time preview of component behavior and state changes
- **FR-010**: Design tokens MUST be centrally managed so updates propagate to all consuming components
- **FR-011**: Components MUST maintain visual and behavioral consistency across different usage contexts
- **FR-012**: System MUST ensure color combinations meet WCAG contrast requirements for accessibility

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Design Tokens**: Centralized values for colors, spacing, typography, radii, and shadows that define the visual language
- **UI Components**: Reusable interface elements (buttons, cards, inputs, etc.) that consume design tokens and provide consistent behavior
- **Component Variants**: Different visual styles or sizes of components (primary/secondary buttons, different card layouts)
- **Component States**: Interactive states like default, hover, focus, disabled, and loading that components can exhibit
- **Accessibility Properties**: Focus indicators, ARIA attributes, color contrast ratios, and motion preferences that ensure usability
- **Sandbox Environment**: Interactive preview space that demonstrates all component variants and states for reference and testing
