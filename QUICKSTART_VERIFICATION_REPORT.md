2. **Visual Testing**: Implement Chromatic or similar for visual regression testing
3. **E2E Testing**: Add Playwright tests specifically for accessibility scenarios
4. **Documentation**: Consider adding Storybook for component documentation

<Button startIcon={<PlusIcon />} loading>Add Item</Button>
```

### ✅ Input Usage Examples

// All validation states work correctly
<Input state="error" errorMessage="Email is required" type="email" required />
<Input startIcon={<SearchIcon />} helperText="Search by name or email" clearable />
```

### ✅ Card Usage Examples

// Interactive and static cards both function perfectly
<Card interactive onClick={handleClick}>
  <CardHeader>Card Title</CardHeader>
  <CardContent>Interactive card content</CardContent>
